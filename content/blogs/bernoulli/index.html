  This post aims to provide a simple derivation of Bernoulli's equation in
  fluid dynamics:

  $$ \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g h + p = C, $$

  where $h$ is the depth, $p$ is the pressure, and $C$ is an arbitrary value
  constant for all points in the fluid.

  Consider a very small cube of side length $dr$ in the liquid, then given the
  density of the liquid, $\rho$, the mass of this cube is $\rho dr^3$.  Also,
  the cube experiences forces due to pressure, and, for instance, in the
  $x$-direction, the resultant force is the difference in pressure multiplied
  by cross-section area, which is $-(\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} dr) dr^2$,
  or simply $-\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} dr^3$; the negative sign is due to
  that the force pushing to the right is caused by the pressure on the left
  side.

  Apply Newton's second law in all directions, and we have

  $$-\frac{\partial p}{\partial \mathbf{r}} = \rho \cdot \mathbf{a}.$$

  If the fluid is in some kind of equilibrium, so that $p$ is only a function
  of radius $\mathbf{r}$, in other words, the pressure at a point does not vary
  with time, then the partial derivative of pressure $p$ w.r.t. $\mathbf{r}$ is
  equivalent to its total derivative, and following the standard steps of
  solving a differential equation, we get

  $$ - \int dp = \int \rho \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} \cdot d \mathbf{r}. $$

  With the right hand side being rewritten as $\int \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot d
  \mathbf{v}$, Bernoulli's equation can be obtained.

  Another derivation can be given by considering

  $$ \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 - p $$

  as the lagrangian of the cube, and by applying using Noether's theorem with
  time symmetry, the generalized energy is

  $$ \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + p, $$

  which is conserved.
