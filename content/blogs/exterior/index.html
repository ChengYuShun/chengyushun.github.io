<h2> Abstract </h2>

<p> Formulas

  \begin{equation}

  d = \frac{|\ve{n} \cdot \ve{r} - a|}{|\ve{n}|}

  \label{plane_distance}
  \end{equation}

  and

  \begin{equation}

  d = \frac{|\ve{b} \times (\ve{r} - \ve{a})|}{|\ve{b}|}

  \label{line_distance}
  \end{equation}

  are useful in calculating the shortest distance between a point and a line or
  a plane in 3D space, but the uses of dot and cross products seem random and
  unable to be generalized into higher dimensions.  This article discusses an
  interpretation of the two formulas, and hence provides a generalization.  It
  also acts as an introduction to exterior product, which, the author believes,
  is the very idea behind these formulas.
</p>

<h2> The Formulas </h2>

<p> There is something interesting about \eqref{plane_distance} where
  \(\ve{r}\) is the the position vector of a point, \(\ve{n} \cdot \ve{r} = a\)
  is the equation of a plane, and \(d\) is the shortest distance between them.
  Note that the dot product \(\ve{n} \cdot \ve{r}\) appears in both the plane
  equation and the distance formula.  A simple way to think of this is that
  when a point is on the plane, the distance between the point and the plane
  must be zero, that is to say

  \[ \ve{n} \cdot \ve{r} - a = 0, \]

  which is equivalent to our plane equation.
</p>

<p> Now let's consider the case of a point and a line.  With the position
  vector of a point being \(\ve{r}\), and the equation of a line being \(\ve{r}
  = \ve{a} + \lambda \ve{b}\), the distance is given by \eqref{line_distance},
  which means, following the same idea as above, the line must have another
  equation

  \begin{equation}

  \ve{b} \times \ve{r} = \ve{b} \times \ve{a}.

  \label{line_eq}
  \end{equation}

  In fact, if we have a vector equation of a plane, just like a vector equation
  of a line,

  \[ \ve{r} = \ve{a} + \lambda \ve{b} + \mu \ve{c}, \]

  the cartesian equation that corresponds to it would be

  \begin{equation}

  (\ve{b} \times \ve{c}) \cdot \ve{r} = (\ve{b} \times \ve{c}) \cdot \ve{a},

  \label{plane_eq}
  \end{equation}

  which might suggest a different way of understanding the equations.
</p>

<p> Firstly, the expression \((\ve{b} \times \ve{c}) \cdot \ve{a}\) is the same
  thing as the determinant of the matrix with \(\ve{b}\), \(\ve{c}\), and
  \(\ve{a}\) being its column vectors.  This will become obvious later, but you
  can readily prove this algebraically.  Also, a determinant is not only an
  enlargement factor, but also the signed volume of the parallelepiped
  (i.e. the 3D version of a parallelogram) formed by the column vectors.  This
  is like the core idea behind determinants.  With that said, \eqref{plane_eq}
  is effectively saying that the volume formed by vectors \(\ve{b}\),
  \(\ve{c}\), and \(\ve{r}\) equals the volume formed by vectors \(\ve{b}\),
  \(\ve{c}\), and \(\ve{a}\).  For the two volumes to be equal, vector
  \(\ve{r}\) must have the same height \(h\) as vector \(\ve{a}\), relative to
  the shared base formed by vectors \(\ve{b}\) and \(\ve{c}\).

  <!-- The diagram of a plane equation. -->
  <center>
    <img src="plane-eq.svg">
  </center>

  Therefore, the locus of vector \(\ve{r}\) should be parallel to the plane of
  the base, which explains why our equation is an equation of a plane.  We can
  also explain our formula of distance this way.  When we have

  \[ (\ve{b} \times \ve{c}) \cdot (\ve{r} - \ve{a}) \]

  in the numerator, we are actually calculating the volume with the
  <q>height vector</q> being the difference of vectors \(\ve{r}\) and
  \(\ve{a}\);

  <!-- The diagram of the distance between a point and a plane. -->
  <center>
    <img src="plane-dist.svg">
  </center>

  when we divide that by \(|\ve{b} \times \ve{c}|\), which is the area of the
  base, we are getting the actual height of the vector \((\ve{r} - \ve{a})\),
  perpendicular to the base, and that is the distance \(d\) between the plane
  and the point.
</p>

<p> Let's look at lines now.  For equation \eqref{line_eq}, we are using cross
  product solely, which kind of like the <q>directional area,</q> compared to
  volumes calculated by determinants.  A cross product of two vectors has its
  magnitude being the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors, and
  its direction being normal to both vectors.  Here, since \(\ve{b} \times
  \ve{r}\) has the same direction as \(\ve{b} \times \ve{a}\), the plane of
  vectors \(\ve{b}\) and \(\ve{r}\) is actually the same as the plane of
  vectors \(\ve{b}\) and \(\ve{a}\).  That is to say, vectors \(\ve{r}\),
  \(\ve{a}\), \(\ve{b}\) are coplanar.  The magnitudes of the two cross
  products are also equal.  Since they are areas of two parallelograms on the
  same plane with the same base \(\ve{b}\),

  <!-- The diagram of a line equation. -->
  <center>
    <img src="line-eq.svg">
  </center>

  it is obvious that that vector \(\ve{r}\) should have the same height \(h\)
  relative to the base as vector \(\ve{a}\), and the locus of \(\ve{r}\) is a
  line passing through \(\ve{a}\) and parallel to \(\ve{b}\).  For formula
  \eqref{line_distance}, which calculates the shortest distance between a
  point and a line, we could consider \(\ve{b} \times (\ve{r} - \ve{a})\) as
  the directional area formed by base \(\ve{b}\) and height vector \((\ve{r} -
  \ve{a})\), which is the vector pointing from a point on the line to the point
  \(\ve{r}\).

  <!-- The diagram of the distance between a point and a line. -->
  <center>
    <img src="line-dist.svg">
  </center>

  If we divide that by the base \(|\ve{b}|\), we are going to get the height
  that is perpendicular to the base, or just the distance \(d\) from the point
  to the line, which is what we want to calculate.
</p>

<h2> Exterior Products </h2>

<p> Note that we basically utilized the idea of volumes and directional areas
  to derive the equation for a linear object (i.e. a line, plane, or any
  higher-dimensional object), and to calculate the distance from a point to that
  object.  Therefore, it is potentially helpful to consider the properties that
  directional hypervolumes might have.
</p>

<h3> Properties </h3>

<p> Let's denote the volume of the parallelepiped formed by vectors \(\ve{a}\),
  \(\ve{b}\), and \(\ve{c}\) as \(V(\ve{a}, \ve{b}, \ve{c})\), and the area
  formed by vectors \(\ve{a}\) and \(\ve{b}\) as \(A(\ve{a}, \ve{b})\).  It
  seems that instead of calculating the volume \(V(\ve{a}, \ve{b}, \ve{c})\)
  directly, we could first of all calculate the directional area \(A(\ve{a},
  \ve{b})\), and then combine the magnitude of that area as well as its
  direction with the third vector \(\ve{c}\), namely taking taking vectors
  \(\ve{a}\) and \(\ve{b}\) as the base, and multiplying it by the height.  We
  could also take vectors \(\ve{b}\) and \(\ve{c}\) or vectors \(\ve{a}\) and
  \(\ve{c}\) as the base, multiplied by the height of the remaining vector,
  getting the same volume.  This fact suggests that the directional hypervolume
  of vectors follows something similar to associative law, in other words,
  \(V(A(\ve{a}, \ve{b}), \ve{c}) = V(\ve{a}, A(\ve{b}, \ve{c}))\); but
  apparently, associativity can only exist in binary operations, so let's try
  to redefine the calculation of hypervolumes as a binary operation, and see
  what is going to happen by considering a few properties of this operation.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p> <strong>Definition</strong> In an \(n\)-dimensional vector space, denote
  the directional hypervolume of the parallelotope (a higher-dimensional
  generalization of parallelograms and parallelepipeds) formed by the vectors
  \(\ve{a}_1, \ve{a}_2, \ldots, \ve{a}_m\) as \((\ve{a}_1 \wedge \ve{a}_2
  \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a}_m)\), where \(m \le n\).  The operation
  \(\wedge\) is known as <dfn>exterior product</dfn>, or <dfn>wedge
  product</dfn>.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p id="prop_1">
  <strong>Property 1</strong> Exterior product satisfies associative law, i.e.

  \[ (\ve{a} \wedge \ve{b}) \wedge \ve{c} = \ve{a} \wedge (\ve{b} \wedge
  \ve{c}). \]

  This is implied when we wrote

  \[ \ve{a}_1 \wedge \ve{a}_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a}_m. \]
</p>

&nbsp;

<p>
  <a id="prop_2"></a><strong>Property 2</strong> Exterior product is negated
  when any two vectors are swapped, i.e.

  \[ \ldots \wedge \ve{a} \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{b} \wedge \ldots = - (\ldots
  \wedge \ve{b} \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a} \wedge \ldots). \]
</p>

<p>
  If we swap any two vectors, they are still the same collection of vectors,
  but in a different orientation, so we will have the same magnitude, with the
  exact opposite direction.  An important implication of this property is that

  \begin{equation}

  \ldots \wedge \ve{a} \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a} \wedge \ldots = 0.

  \label{alternating_to_zero}
  \end{equation}
</p>

&nbsp;

<p>
  <a id="prop_3"></a><strong>Property 3</strong> Exterior multiplication
  distributes over addition, i.e.

  \[ \ldots \wedge (\alpha + \beta) \wedge \ldots = (\ldots \wedge \alpha
  \wedge \ldots) + (\ldots \wedge \beta \wedge \ldots), \]

  where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) can be either vectors or exterior products of
  the same number of vectors.
</p>

<p>
  This is property cannot be proved directly, but the words below are
  attempting to give you an idea of where this comes from.  Let's firstly
  consider a simpler case, where \(m\) equals \(n\), in other words, the
  dimension of the space equals the number of vectors, and we will only
  consider addition between vectors, not exterior products, since we haven't
  defined additions for them yet.  With that given, an exterior product is
  basically an \(n\)-dimensional hypervolume in an \(n\)-dimensional space,
  with no direction but a sign representing the orientation of the vectors.
  Then if you divide one of the vectors into two vectors, the height of the
  original vector would just equal the sum of the heights of the two new
  vectors, relative to the base formed by the rest of the vectors.

  <!-- The diagram of distributive law for determinants. -->
  <center>
    <img src="distributive.svg">
  </center>

  The heights become hypervolumes when multiplied by the shared base, so
  basically we can conclude a special case of this property,

  \begin{equation}
  \label{prop_3_spec}

  \ldots \wedge (\ve{a} + \ve{b}) \wedge \ldots = (\ldots \wedge \ve{a}
  \wedge \ldots) + (\ldots \wedge \ve{b} \wedge \ldots),

  \end{equation}

  where both sides are exterior products of \(n\) vectors.  Note that this
  already allows us to calculate determinants, which are equivalent to exterior
  products that we are considering, since they are both calculating
  hypervolumes of the same dimension.  By using this property, we could rewrite
  the product into the form \(a(\ve{e}_1 \wedge \ve{e}_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge
  \ve{e}_n)\), where \(a\) is a scalar, and vectors \(\ve{e}_1\) to
  \(\ve{e}_n\) are the standard basis.  This is true because any other
  combinations of these vectors would necessarily duplicate, which results in
  \(0\) according to \eqref{alternating_to_zero}, and any other permutations
  could be rewritten as this one after a few swaps
  using <a href="#prop_2">Property 2</a>.  To further evaluate a determinant,
  the exterior product \((\ve{e}_1 \wedge \ve{e}_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge
  \ve{e}_n)\) could be considered as \(1\), for it is effectively the
  hypervolume a unit hypercube.  You can find more details (and other
  interesting stuff) in
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23LLB9mNJvc">this video</a>.
</p>

<p> A determinant may be considered as a scalar, but generally speaking, most
  exterior products have directions, despite the fact that they are not simply
  vector directions.  That leaves us a question: how do we know if two
  directions are the same, and what exactly makes two exterior products equal
  to each other.  We may define two exterior products of the same quantity of
  vectors, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), to be equal if and only if

  \[ \alpha \wedge \gamma = \beta \wedge \gamma, \]

  where \(\gamma\) is an arbitrary exterior product.  Since we already have
  determinants defined, an easy way to utilize this definition is to arrange
  the number of vectors that make up \(\gamma\) so that \(\alpha \wedge
  \gamma\) and \(\beta \wedge \gamma\) are both determinants, which we already
  know how to calculate.
</p>

<p> After being able to verify whether two exterior products are equal, we
  still have to find a way in which we can determine the sum of two exterior
  products.  Following the same idea, we define <a href="#prop_3">Property
  3</a> in an equivalent form: the exterior products \(\alpha\) and \((\beta +
  \gamma)\) are to be equal if and only if

  \[ \alpha \wedge \delta = (\beta \wedge \delta) + (\gamma \wedge \delta), \]

  where that \(\delta\) is again an arbitrary exterior product.  Note that this
  definition is consistent with vector addition, since, as we have seen in
  \eqref{prop_3_spec}, exterior multiplication already distributes over vector
  addition.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p>
  Hitherto, with its three properties, exterior product has already
  been properly defined.  Let's look at an example of how the calculation is
  done.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p>
  <a id="example:cross"></a><strong>Example</strong> Calculate

  \[ \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{bmatrix} \wedge \begin{bmatrix} d \\ e \\
  f \end{bmatrix}. \]
</p>

<p>
  Rewrite each vector into the form \(a \ve{i} + b \ve{j} + c \ve{k}\),
  applying <a href="#prop_3">Property 3</a>, and then we have

  <a id="cross_product"></a> \[ (ae - bd) (\ve{i} \wedge \ve{j}) + (bf - ce)
  (\ve{j} \wedge \ve{k}) + (cd - af) (\ve{k} \wedge \ve{i}), \]

  which has its components exactly the same as the cross product of the two
  vectors.  This makes sense because we are aiming to calculate directional
  hypervolumes, and cross product is basically directional area.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p> We still have to figure how to find the magnitude of an exterior product,
  i.e. its hypervolume.  In the case of cross products, the norm of the
  resulting vector is the maginitude of directional area.  Therefore, we might
  make a reasonable inference that adding the square of every individual
  component in an exterior product would give us the the square of that
  hypervolume, in the same way as taking the norm of a vector.  An informal
  proof is provided below, but you may also take this result as granted, and
  skip the proof part.
</p>

<h3> Norms </h3>

<p> Define the square root of the sum of squares of all components of an
  exterior product as its <dfn>norm</dfn>, written as \(\norm{\alpha}\).  For
  instance, the norm of the exterior product in
  the <a href="#example:cross">last example</a> is

  \[ \sqrt{(ae - bd)^2 + (bf - ce)^2 + (cd - af)^2}. \]

  Denote the hypervolume formed by vectors \(\ve{a}_1\) to \(\ve{a}_m\) as
  \(V(\ve{a}_1, \ve{a}_2, \ldots, \ve{a}_m)\); we might also use this notation
  in a subtler way, as we already have.  We will prove that the magnitude of a
  hypervolume equals the norm of the exterior product that corresponds to it,
  in other words,

  \[ \norm{\ve{a}_1 \wedge \ve{a}_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a}_m} =
  V(\ve{a}_1, \ve{a}_2, \ldots, \ve{a}_m), \]

  or equivalently, as \(V\) is positive,

  \begin{equation} \label{norm_vol}

  \norm{\ve{a}_1 \wedge \ve{a}_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a}_m}^2 =
  V^2(\ve{a}_1, \ve{a}_2, \ldots, \ve{a}_m).

  \end{equation}
</p>

&nbsp;

<p> <strong>Projections</strong> We will use the idea of projection quite
  often, so it is worth to first of all mention some ideas about it.
</p>

<p>
  To project an object in some direction, the easiest way is to drop the
  components that are parallel it, since all those components will be zero
  after the projection.  Components of an exterior product can be considered as
  projections.  For an exterior product of \(m\) vectors in an
  \(n\)-dimensional space, it is not hard to see that there are \(^nC_m\)
  components in total.  Each of them contains \(m\) base vectors, and it may be
  considered as the projection of the object in all directions except those.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p> We will use mathematical induction.  Suppose that in a vector space of
  dimension \((n - 1)\), equation \eqref{norm_vol} always holds.  We are going
  to show that the same equation holds in an \(n\)-dimensional vector space.
</p>

<p> When there are \(n\) vectors, there is only one component, the determinant,
  in the exterior product, and it equals the hypervolume \(V(\ve{a}_1,
  \ve{a}_2, \ldots, \ve{a}_n)\), so the relation \eqref{norm_vol} is obviously
  true.
</p>

<p> When there are less than \(n\) vectors, suppose there are \(m\) vectors,
  \(\ve{a}_1\) to \(\ve{a}_m\), where \(m\) is less than \(n\).  Given one of
  the standard unit vectors, \(\ve{e}\), each vector can be resolved into the
  form \(\ve{a}'_i + a\ve{e}\), and \(\ve{a}'_i\) is a vector that does not
  have any \(\ve{e}\) component; then, the left hand side of \eqref{norm_vol}
  can be rewritten as

  \[ \norm{\ve{a}'_1 \wedge \ve{a}'_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a}'_m + \omega
  \wedge \ve{e}}^2, \]

  where \(\omega\) is an exterior product.  Since the two terms has no
  components in common, it can be further decomposed, so we have

  \begin{equation} \label{two_proj}

  \norm{\ve{a}_1 \wedge \ve{a}_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a}_m}^2 =
  \norm{\ve{a}'_1 \wedge \ve{a}'_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a}'_m}^2 +
  \norm{\omega \wedge \ve{e}}^2.

  \end{equation}
</p>

<p> The expression \((\ve{a}'_1 \wedge \ve{a}'_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge
  \ve{a}'_m)\), has no \(\ve{e}\) components, so it is basically of dimension
  \((n - 1)\), and after applying our assumption for mathematical induction, we
  get
  
  \begin{equation} \label{proj_h_volume}

  \norm{\ve{a}'_1 \wedge \ve{a}'_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a}'_m}^2 =
  V^2(\ve{a}'_1, \ve{a}'_2, \ldots, \ve{a}'_m).

  \end{equation}

  The vector \(\ve{a}'_i\) can be obtained by dropping the \(\ve{e}\) component
  of vector \(\ve{a}_i\), which is equivalent to projecting vector \(\ve{a}_i\)
  onto a space that is perpendicular to \(\ve{e}\).

  <!-- The diagram of a surface projected onto a plane. -->
  <center>
    <img src="proj_h.svg">
  </center>

  Suppose the angle between the object and the space is \(\theta\), then since
  \(V\) is projected by an angle of \(\theta\), it is multiplied by a factor of
  \(\cos \theta\).  Together with \eqref{proj_h_volume}, we get

  \begin{equation} \label{cos_2}

  \norm{\ve{a}'_1 \wedge \ve{a}'_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a}'_m}^2 =
  V^2(\ve{a}_1, \ve{a}_2, \ldots, \ve{a}_m) \cos^2 \theta.

  \end{equation}
</p>

<p> Following the same idea, the expression \(\norm{\omega \wedge \ve{e}}^2\)
  can be considered as the sum of squares of a few projections.  Denote the
  factor of a projection as \(k\), and then we have

  \[ \begin{align*} \norm{\omega \wedge \ve{e}}^2 & = \sum \text{projection}^2
  \\ & = \sum (k_iV)^2 \\ & = V^2 \sum k_i^2. \end{align*} \]

  If we cut the object into slices, then since they are all parallel to each
  other, factors \(k\)'s would be identical for all of them.  Let's find \(\sum
  k_i^2\) for a specific slice.  Consider a slice obtained by two cuts
  perpendicular to the \(\ve{e}\) direction, with an infinitasimally small
  distance between them, so it is almost of dimension \((m - 1)\), one
  dimension lower than the original object.  Denote its <q>height</q> in the
  \(\ve{e}\) direction as \(\delta h\), its <q>width</q> perpendicular to the
  cuts as \(\delta w\), its \((m - 1)\)-dimensional hypervolume as \(\lambda\),
  and the projection of \(\lambda\) as \(l\).

  <!-- Diagram of a single slice and its projection. -->
  <center>
    <img src="proj_v.svg">
  </center>

  \(\lambda\) is projected onto a space of dimension \(m\), one higher than
  itself, but since the \(\ve{e}\) component is predictably zero, it is
  equivalent to an \((m - 1)\)-dimensional projection.  Hence, \(l\) has no
  direction.  Taking the products \(V(\lambda) \times \delta w\) and \(l \times
  \delta h\) as approximately the hypervolumes of the unprojected and the
  projected hypervolumes, respectively, we have

  \[ \begin{align*} \sum k_i^2 & = \frac{\sum
  V^2(\text{projection})}{V^2(\text{slice})} \\

  & = \frac{\sum l_i^2 \delta h^2}{V^2(\lambda) \delta w^2} \\

  & = \frac{\sum l_i^2}{V^2(\lambda)} \sin^2 \theta. \end{align*}
  \]

  The \(l\)'s are basically all the \(^{n - 1}C_{m - 1}\) projections of
  \(\lambda\) , in directions perpendicular to \(\ve{e}\), so the numerator is
  the same as \(\norm{\lambda}^2\).  Apply our assumption again, and we have

  \[ \sum k_i^2 = \sin^2 \theta, \]

  which means

  \begin{equation} \label{sin_2}

  \norm{\omega \wedge \ve{e}}^2 = V^2 \sin^2 \theta.

  \end{equation}
</p>

<p> Finally, add \eqref{cos_2} and \eqref{sin_2}, and from \eqref{two_proj}, we
  obtain

  \[ \norm{\ve{a}_1 \wedge \ve{a}_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a}_m}^2 =
  V^2(\ve{a}_1, \ve{a}_2, \ldots, \ve{a}_m).\]

  It is obvious that we can show \eqref{norm_vol} in a lower dimension, so by
  mathematical induction, we have proved that \eqref{norm_vol} is true in all
  dimensions.

<h2> Back to Formulas </h2>

<p> We are now able to write the distance formulas in a more general way.  For
  an object with a vector equation

  \[ \ve{r} = \ve{a} + \sum_{i = 1}^{m} s_i \ve{a}_i, \]

  denote \((\ve{a}_1 \wedge \ve{a}_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge \ve{a}_m)\) as
  \(\alpha\), so the equation can be rewritten equivalently in wedge notation
  as

  \[ \alpha \wedge \ve{r} = \alpha \wedge \ve{a}, \]

  and the distance between a point with position vector \(\ve{r}\) and the
  object is

  \[ \frac{\norm{\alpha \wedge (\ve{r} - \ve{a})}}{\norm{\alpha}}. \]
</p>
